      <h3>A Day in the Life of Olivia</h3>
<p>Today is a big day for Olivia. It’s 6am and she’s already on the
  road headed to Detroit for a day-long offsite company training.
  A few miles in, she’s up for a quick breakfast. “Can you find the
  best diner on the route, maximum 20 miles from here?” “I
  found a place 12 miles away. It’s all booked.”. “Thanks.” </p>

<p>Not long after finishing her breakfast, Olivia gets an audio note.
  “You’ve just received a calendar invite from Anna Dean, 9 to
  10am tomorrow. According to your calendar, you are available.
  Shall I accept?” “Umm… Yes. Accept and add ‘Looking forward
  to the meeting.”</p>

<p>6pm, Olivia is finally headed home. Today was draining for
Olivia; she looks exhausted. “Olivia, it seems like you had a
long and stressful day. Shall I book your favourite yoga class
tomorrow and make space in your calendar for meditation?”
“Yes, that’d be great.”</p>

<p>“Olivia, it’s 8pm, bedtime for Clara. Do you want me to connect
to her room so you can say good night?” “Absolutely, please.”
Olivia's vehicle turns on assist mode so she can interact with
her daughter from the HD windshield display. “Good night
sweetie, I love you and see you tomorrow morning.”</p>

her connected vehicle start again.</p>
